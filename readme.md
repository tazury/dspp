# DualSense++
## THIS IS NOT FINISHED [THERE ARE MANY ISSUES IN THIS LIBRARY I PLAN TO FIX. Make a issue if you find anything]
## An C++ Library designed for the usage of multiple DualSense controller support within gameplay.
- DS++ is an Team Azury project towards the game development community into unifiying DualSense controller support for video games outside of the PS5 SDK.
- Most game developers would not add their dualsense features to PC releases due to the lack of support or documentation that can make it worth. *DualSense++ can solve that!*

### What can it do?
* DualSense++ has native support for **adaptive triggers, haptic feedback and touchpad** on both bluetooth and USB connections. 
* Capabilities of controlling the whole controller's output system (Colors, buttons, speakers).
* A Input System that is designed to be fast and simple to use.
